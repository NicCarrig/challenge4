# Week 4 Challenge - Coding Quiz

The goal of this challenge was to create a coding quiz with a timer.

When you click the start button, the timer will be set to 90 and then start counting down. The first question will then show as well as 4 buttons with the answer options. When a question is answered correctly, 10 points will be added to the end score and the user will see "correct" under the answers that disappears after 3 seconds.

The quiz ends when either all of the questions are answered or the timer reachs 0.
The final score is the points gained from answering correctly plus the remaining seconds lef tone the timer.
